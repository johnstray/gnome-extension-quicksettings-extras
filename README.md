## About

I welcome any and all suggestions for future improvements, and if you find any bugs, then please let me know.

This extension is currently under active development, but is a little while away from completion and ready for release yet. If you’d like to track the development progress, please follow this GitHub project

A new team of translators will be needed for this plugin. If you speak any languages other than those that are already included, then please send me a PM so that I can add you to the project. A GitHub account is a must as the development process is maintained from there.

- Inhibits the computer from entering a sleep state or screensaver
